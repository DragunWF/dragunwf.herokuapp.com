          Hi there, welcome to my about page where I display various information
          about this website and myself. As you all may have guessed, this
          website is named after my username on the internet, DragunWF /
          DragonWF.
        </p>
        <p class="page-description" id="p1">
          I first discovered programming back in 2019 with the Godot engine
          coding games and stuff, during that time I didn't have a proper
          learning path and I wasn't really taking it that seriously so I pretty
          much didn't improve as much. It was on October 11 2021, when I
          actually started to learn programming seriously.
        </p>
        <p class="page-description" id="p2">
          From time to time in my free time, whenever I'm not working on a
          project I usually go solve programming algorithms on
          <a href="/socials/codewars" target="_blank" class="text-links"
            >codewars</a
          >
          or just go learn some new concepts about programming. Although in some
          cases, I do get burnt out though and whenever that happens I usually
          just go back to playing my favorite games to recharge.
        </p>
        <p class="page-description" id="p3">
          The games I play usually play during days are games like Minecraft,
          Dead Cells, Enderal, and others. You can check out my
          <a href="/socials/steam" target="_blank" class="text-links"
            >steam profile</a
          >
          to see my recent gaming activity. Maybe for anyone reading this, we
          could play some games together.
        </p>
        <p class="page-description" id="p4">
          If you read this far and want a place to talk to me, perhaps you could
          join my
          <a href="/socials/discord" target="_blank" class="text-links"
            >discord server</a
          >
          where we can talk about anything. One warning though, sometimes there
          are some strange things that get posted on my server so proceed with
          caution hehe.
