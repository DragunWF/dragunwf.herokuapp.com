          Hi there, welcome to my about page where I display various information
          about this website and myself. As you all may have guessed, this
          website is named after my username on the internet, DragunWF /
          DragonWF.
        </p>
        <p class="page-description" id="p1">
          I first discovered programming back in 2019 with the Godot engine
          coding games and stuff, during that time I didn't have a proper
          learning path and I wasn't really taking it that seriously so I pretty
          much didn't improve as much. It was on October 11 2021, when I
          actually started to learn programming seriously.
        </p>
        <p class="page-description" id="p2">
          As of right now, I'm currently in a training arc to become better at
          programming. For most of my freetime, I'm usually using it to code and
          learn more about coding/programming concepts to improve on my skills.
          Although in some cases, I do get burnt out but whenever that happens I
          usually play some video games or watch movies on Netflix to recharge.
        </p>
        <p class="page-description" id="p3">
          The games I play usually play during days are games like Minecraft,
          Dead Cells, Enderal, and others. You can check out my

          to see my recent gaming activity. Maybe for anyone reading this, we
          could play some games together.
        </p>

          If you read this far and want a place to talk to me, perhaps you could
          join my
          <a href="https://discord.gg/9JdnnPN" class="text-links"
            >discord server</a
          >
          where we can talk about anything. One warning though, sometimes there
          are some strange things that get posted on my server so proceed with
          caution hehe.
